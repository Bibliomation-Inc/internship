== What is Evergreen?

Evergreen is an open-source Integrated Library System (ILS) designed for libraries of all types and sizes. It provides a robust set of features for managing library operations, including cataloging, circulation, and patron management. Evergreen is built on a modular architecture, allowing for easy customization and integration with other systems.

== Core Technologies

Evergreen is primarily developed using:

- **PostgreSQL**: The database backend for storing all library data.
- **Perl**: The primary programming language used for Evergreen backend development.
- **Angular**: The primary framework used for Evergreen frontend development.
- **Antora**: The documentation site generator used for Evergreen's documentation. Also used to deploy this site.
