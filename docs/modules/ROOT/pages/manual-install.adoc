= Manual Build & Install

This page is a companion to the official Evergreen community install guide. Use the community guide as your single source of truth; this page provides goals, verification steps, and deliverables.

== Official Guide
- Install guide (3.13): https://evergreen-ils.org/documentation/install/README_3_13.html
- Choose the guide that matches your Evergreen version and OS/distro.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Use a fresh VM or container and take snapshots at key checkpoints.
====

== How to Use This Page
- Read the official guide for your target version/distro.
- Perform the install strictly by the guide.
- Use the verification checklist and deliverables below to confirm success and capture findings.

== Decide and Record
Capture these up front in your notes:

- Evergreen version and branch used
- OS/distro and version
- Hostname/domain chosen
- PostgreSQL version
- Any local deviations required by your environment

== Verify Your Install (Acceptance Criteria)
Your install is successful when:

- All services start without errors (OpenSRF and Evergreen)
- OPAC and staff client load in the browser
- You can log in with an admin account
- Database connections (psql/pgAdmin) work to the Evergreen database
- Logs show no recurring errors after initial startup

== Deliverables

A README (or notes) including: (Feel free to host this in your own GitHub repository and include a link)

  - Exact guide followed (URL and version)
  - Commands run only where they differed from the guide
  - Deviations and why they were needed
  - Issues encountered and resolutions
  - Verification results (URLs used, accounts tested)

== Tips (Not a Replacement for the Guide)
- Use distro package names and commands from the guide; do not substitute.
- Favor supported PostgreSQL versions noted in the guide.
- Keep terminal history; it helps produce accurate notes.
